In this project, we discussed feature selection with PCA and Lasso approaches. 

Then, we implemented a decision tree model, discussed optimal parameter selection, assessed the features relevancy in this specific model. 
We tried implementing a KNN model, as well as a RF model. Finally we implemented a gradient boosting model, in which we discussed again 
the parameters to pick, as well as the features relevancy in this model. 

We finally computed the predictions for the two models we obtained, computed the entropy based features relevancy using a decision tree model 
and compared them to the ones we had obtained earlier.
